This repository has some changes from the original project:

1.  **Usage of Indian Cities and Geographical Data:**
    
    -   Instead of the original locations, this project now uses Indian cities and their geographical data. 

2.  **Location Coordinates Update:**
    -   In the original project, updating the location of a campground did not automatically adjust the location coordinates on the map. This shortcoming has been addressed, ensuring that when the location is updated, the map coordinates are adjusted accordingly.

3.  **Map Rendering and Coordinates:**
    -   While the original project used Mapbox and its map API, the project now utilizes  [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)  and the  [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/) API  for rendering the map and finding coordinates. This change allows for a seamless development of project without the need for credit card validation for using mapbox.
    
4.  **Hosting on [render.com](https://render.com/):**
    -   The original project was hosted on Heroku, but since Herokuâ€™s trial is also credit card protected, the project is now hosted on  **[render.com](https://render.com/)**.
